DOCUMENTATION

What is this?
-------------
The Digital Music Stand is a way of displaying music score using a
monitor, rather than having bits of paper, which are usually in 
the wrong order, or fall off at the wrong moment.

The key concept is that you set up your "playlist" of music 
beforehand, then you can display it, one item at a time. 
You can use a computer monitor, or a laptop, if the screen isn't
too small. 

Then, to change pages, you hit a key on the keyboard. The left-hand
letters are mapped to "go back" and the right-hand letters are mapped
to "go forwards", so you don't need to be accurate when you're in the
middle of playing something and need to "turn the page".



Playlists

Warmups first, then stuff you need to learn, then play
something you do know
