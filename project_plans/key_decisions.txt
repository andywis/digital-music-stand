1. Flask
    I wanted to use Python, and Flask or Django seemed like 
    good options. Django seemed a bit heavyweight, and mandates
    the use of an Apache Front-end in production, which isn't
    relevant here, as we intend to only serve to "localhost"

2. Add a score to the playlist as a set of pages
    Adding a score (which may consist of several pages)
    to a playlist adds each page in turn. I deliberated for
    ages about whether a playlist should be a list of scores
    or a list of pages, and had to decide one way or the other.
    Hopefully there should be enough metadata being going to
    the browser to improve the UI on this. It also allows you
    to insert one score inside another, if that's really what
    you want to do.
