Tasks:
------
P1: Ability to set different playlists.

P3: Key presses don't work in Firefox (only in Chrome)



/!\ Remove all non-copyright music from the Git repo. Completely purge!!
    add a .gitignore in the static folder.

/!\ Rebuild VENV -- it's broken. Can't install py.test. It needs an installer too.


Tests: Needs some automated tests.

Tests: Migrate the tests to py.tests (and tox?)

Tests: add pep8 test to the tests.

Move key-press key map to a separate file so it can be modified for users
with a different keyboard layout. (possibly incl MacBook?)

Launcher: How do you make a launcher that works in Gnome?
	? http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/156126/how-do-i-add-a-launcher-in-gnome-on-fedora-20

Nav: make the "Prev" and "Next" buttons prettier (real buttons?)

Add a Favicon

Generate the image and the playlist from raw data.

Bring "learn your scales" CGI in to the software (as an in-built 'app')

Editing tools:
	Use Imagemagick or pdftohtml to convert PDFs to PNGs automatically
	e.g. http://superuser.com/questions/185880/how-to-convert-a-pdf-document-to-png


Would be great to be able to use a USB Footswitch instead of the keyboard
possibly investigate other hardware interfaces too. This might need an API
that other devices could use to change page; may need websockets.

DOCUMENT: The onkeypress event is not fired for all keys (e.g. ALT, CTRL,
SHIFT, ESC) in all browsers, therefore, key presses only really work on
letters and numbers.







Complete:
-----------
Make the navigation strip cycle through the items in the playlist

Add .gitignore (.pyc and .swp files)

To be able to display a WHOLE page of sheet music on a screen; no scrolling.
I added some CSS directives, and created a demo of "Buddy".

Correct the sizes of the PNG images. max-width:75% isn't always right
using CSS, as above

02/03/2016
Switch to key handlers to make it easier to move right and left.
			You should be able to set it up so you can hit a key
			to move forwards (And backwards) through the playlist.
See tests/manual_tests/key-handler-2.html for the background.

03/03/2016
Load playlist from file

12/03/2016
	Add a Homepage
	Nav doesn't know when to stop at -1 or len(list); make it calculate bounds.
	Add an error handler page (try /p/999)
	pre-fetch images on the next page into memory

	Launcher: How do you make the shell script launcher run the browser?

13/03/2016
	WONTFIX: Would be good to have the daemon running through Apache, always-on.

	Review the "worship.php" files for any other ideas.
    + remove worship.php when done.
	The old PHP script "worship.php" was just a wrapper around a set of Youtube videos
	to play. The data was:
		[
		  {"playlist_id": "1", "title": "Worship songs with Lyrics", "pl": [
			{"id": "WrSwSG65ggY", "title": "Running - Hillsong Live (New 2012 DVD Album Cornerstone)"},
			{"id": "-1zU-fQv6Uc", "title": "Endless Light - Hillsong Live New 2012 Album"},
			{"id": "yg-B9uSNu-w", "title": "Hillsong - Saviour King (1:31)"},
			{"id": "QvLxZEU02uI", "title": "Cornerstone - Cornerstone - Hillsong Live 2012"}
		   ]
		  },
		  {"playlist_id": "2", "title":"Sax Jazz", "pl": [
			{"id": "wgOlPTTol1M", "title": "Harlem Nocturne by Earle Hagen &quot;Dennis Memeo&quot; on Alto Saxo"},
			{"id": "KROObzn04sE", "title": "Harlem Nocturne Blues Backing Track"}
		  ]}
		]

    Design the file structure:
	Filesystem structure in "static/"; each image in its own folder with metadata.
	Directory name should be 7-bit version of the filename.
		static/
		    Blues_Scale_1/
				meta.json           # holds the metadata about this file.
				Blues_Scale_1.png
		    Other_page/
				meta.json
				Other_page.png
			A_local_html_resource:
				meta.json
				content.html
