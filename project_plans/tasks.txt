Tasks:
------
P1: Ability to set different playlists.

P3: Key presses don't work in Firefox (only in Chrome)




Installer must install some default config, otherwise installation gives you an error

Tests: Needs some automated tests.

Tests: Migrate the tests to py.tests (and tox?)

Tests: add pep8 test to the tests.

Move key-press key map to a separate file so it can be modified for users
with a different keyboard layout. (possibly incl MacBook?)

Launcher: How do you make a launcher that works in Gnome?
	? http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/156126/how-do-i-add-a-launcher-in-gnome-on-fedora-20

Nav: make the "Prev" and "Next" buttons prettier (real buttons?)

Add a Favicon

Generate the image and the playlist from raw data.

Bring "learn your scales" CGI in to the software (as an in-built 'app')

Editing tools:
	(0) Use pdftohtml to convert PDFs to PNGs automatically
	(1) Make a page where you can add a PDF file (file system or upload ??)
	(2) Make a Flask page which can convert a PDF file into images, using
		the pdftohtml script 
	(3) Move the images from the converted PDF into static/???
	(bonus) Use Imagemagick if pdftohtml failed
	    e.g. http://superuser.com/questions/185880/how-to-convert-a-pdf-document-to-png
	(bonus) Pretty progress bars for the conversion tools.
	(bonus) detect if pdftohtml and imagemagick are installed.


Would be great to be able to use a USB Footswitch instead of the keyboard
possibly investigate other hardware interfaces too. This might need an API
that other devices could use to change page; may need websockets.

DOCUMENT: The onkeypress event is not fired for all keys (e.g. ALT, CTRL,
SHIFT, ESC) in all browsers, therefore, key presses only really work on
letters and numbers.

There needs to be a way of saving the config, and restoring it, if you
have to re-install (e.g. cd $TARGET; tar cf backup.tar config/ static/)

Detect that the config file has changed, and reload it.

Detect that your browser isn't full-screen and provide a notice to press F11.








Complete:
-----------
Make the navigation strip cycle through the items in the playlist

Add .gitignore (.pyc and .swp files)

To be able to display a WHOLE page of sheet music on a screen; no scrolling.
I added some CSS directives, and created a demo of "Buddy".

Correct the sizes of the PNG images. max-width:75% isn't always right
using CSS, as above

02/03/2016
Switch to key handlers to make it easier to move right and left.
			You should be able to set it up so you can hit a key
			to move forwards (And backwards) through the playlist.
See tests/manual_tests/key-handler-2.html for the background.

03/03/2016
Load playlist from file

12/03/2016
	Add a Homepage
	Nav doesn't know when to stop at -1 or len(list); make it calculate bounds.
	Add an error handler page (try /p/999)
	pre-fetch images on the next page into memory

	Launcher: How do you make the shell script launcher run the browser?


13/03/2016
	WONTFIX: Would be good to have the daemon running through Apache, always-on.

	Review the "worship.php" files for any other ideas.
    + remove worship.php when done.
	The old PHP script "worship.php" was just a wrapper around a set of Youtube videos
	to play. The data was:
		[
		  {"playlist_id": "1", "title": "Worship songs with Lyrics", "pl": [
			{"id": "WrSwSG65ggY", "title": "Running - Hillsong Live (New 2012 DVD Album Cornerstone)"},
			{"id": "-1zU-fQv6Uc", "title": "Endless Light - Hillsong Live New 2012 Album"},
			{"id": "yg-B9uSNu-w", "title": "Hillsong - Saviour King (1:31)"},
			{"id": "QvLxZEU02uI", "title": "Cornerstone - Cornerstone - Hillsong Live 2012"}
		   ]
		  },
		  {"playlist_id": "2", "title":"Sax Jazz", "pl": [
			{"id": "wgOlPTTol1M", "title": "Harlem Nocturne by Earle Hagen &quot;Dennis Memeo&quot; on Alto Saxo"},
			{"id": "KROObzn04sE", "title": "Harlem Nocturne Blues Backing Track"}
		  ]}
		]

    Design the file structure:
	Filesystem structure in "static/"; each image in its own folder with metadata.
	Directory name should be 7-bit version of the filename.
		static/
		    Blues_Scale_1/
				meta.json           # holds the metadata about this file.
				Blues_Scale_1.png
		    Other_page/
				meta.json
				Other_page.png
			A_local_html_resource:
				meta.json
				content.html

16/03/2016
	Created a new Git Repo that doesn't contain any copyrighted material
	The 'static' folder is now generated by an install script.
	The VENV is built by an install script.
